An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Overview Of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to use Kickstarter data to uncover trends, and help budding playright, Louise, gain some insight on how to launch a successful kickstarter campaign. Louise hopes to raise a goal of $10,000 to fund her play "Fever," and would like to know what factors would help to plan a campaign in order to meet her funding goal.

Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis using Excel functions to filter out data, making it relevant to what exactly Louise was hoping to find out and as well as charts to visually represent the data. The challenges I encountered were navigating a new Excel formula and understanding its function as well as limitations. The COUNTIFS formula specifically, is the one that I used create a line chart and it was on that I had never used before. It took a bit of Google-ing as well as asking classmates for clarification on Slack to get the function to work. Once I understood the criteria to have it function properly and what I was missing, I was able to create a working chart. I was initially missing the filter aspect of my formula, so it was pulling from all data, and not just the "plays" data that is relevant to this project
